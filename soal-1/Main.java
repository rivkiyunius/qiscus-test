Below there's a class called BookLibraryApplication with only one method: main.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to add codes _only_ in the sections labeled "PLACE YOUR CODE HERE"
in order to:
1. Make this file compiles without any errors, and
2. Make the resulting application prints as many "true"s as possible. That is, the expected result is something like
   this:
    1  : true
    2  : true
    3  : true
    4  : true
    5  : true
    6  : true
    7  : true
    8  : true
    9  : true
    10 : true

        his own book library.

        to do philanthropic things, and whatnot. But little did they know that Bill is also collecting fiction
        books for his library.
        Travelling around the world, he found the rarest kind of fiction books he wants to collect, like 'Harry Potter'
        series by 'J.K. Rowling', 'The Lord of the Rings' series by 'J.R.R Tolkien', and 'Sherlock Holmes' series by

        Not wanting to waste his time, Bill bought several of those rare books. (Have I tell you that he has a lot of
        money? I mean, a really really lot of money?)

        Stone', and 3 for 'Harry Potter and Chamber of Secrets'). 'The Lord of the Rings' series, on the other hand,
        proven to be quite a challenge even for Bill, he only got 3 of those (1 for 'The Fellowship of the Rings' and
        2 for 'The Two Towers'). Luckily, for 'Sherlock Holmes' series, he found and bought many of those (20 and 10
        books for 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' and 'A Study in Scarlet', respectively.)
